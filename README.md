# What is Rising Phoenix?
This repo is part of a volunteer assignment I'm completing to contribute to the Rising Phoenix EdTech initiative. The goal of Rising Phoenix is to connect Parent's and Guidance counselors of promising students from underfunded school districts with working professionals from a similar background who can help guide them through college prep and college admissions.

My contribution to the project are two apps in progress. 
- Phoenix Web will be a web dashboard for our mentors and University Admissions to track students and communicate with Guidance Counselors
- Phoneix is a mobile application I'm building with React Native to eanable commication between parents, students, Guidance Counselors, University Admissions and Mentors
